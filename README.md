Developed a Machine Learning Model using XGBoost Classifier to predict risk of obesity in individuals. The code involved Data Visualization and preprocessing, experimenting with models such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forests and AdaBoost.
In the end, we have chosen an XGBoost Model which gave us an accuracy score of 90%.
